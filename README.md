💡 *I build things that make people's lives better. Sometimes it's a full-stack product. Sometimes it's a machine learning model. Sometimes it’s just one good line of code.*

### 🔭 A Quick Story About Me

```ts
const bhargavi = {
  currentRole: "Graduate Student @ UCR",
  previous: "Senior Software Engineer @ Mr. Cooper (FinTech)",
  interests: ["AI", "Computer Vision", "Web3", "Data Viz", "System Design"],
  funFact: "I once built a music player controlled entirely by hand gestures 🎵🖐️",
};
I’ve led engineering teams, mentored new developers, and been the person who ships products that users actually love. Whether it's optimizing backend services or designing user flows, I approach problems from both an engineer's and a user’s point of view.

🧠 My Stack

Bonus: I love blending these with tools like MediaPipe, OpenCV, Gemini, and Ollama for AI experiments.
